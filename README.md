# Project 1: SQL Insights â€“ Exploring 120 Years of Olympic Data

* Introduction

This project demonstrates my SQL skills by analyzing the "120 Years of Olympic History" dataset, which spans the modern Olympic Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The dataset, originally sourced from Sports Reference and hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), contains detailed records of over 271,000 athlete-event entries across 15 columns. Each row represents an individual athlete competing in a specific Olympic event, providing a rich foundation for exploring trends, achievements, and patterns in Olympic history.
